       "if you want to know just how bad donald trump s healthcare bill would be for this country, just ask ali chandra.thanks to the affordable care act, chandra was able to get health insurance for her three-year-old son, who has a pre-existing condition known as heterotaxy syndrome, a defect he was born with. heterotaxy syndrome literally means different arrangements,  chandra explained to cnn on sunday. ethan was born with nine heart defects   nine congenital heart defects. he has two left lungs, five or so spleens of dubious function, and his liver and his gallbladder are down the middle of his body along with his heart, and then his stomach is on the right side instead of the left side. here s the video via youtube.any human being, especially parents, should sympathize with chandra and what she and her family are going through.but their situation would be much worse if the trumpcare bill passes congress and is signed into law. the protections guaranteed by the affordable care act, also known as obamacare, would vanish. and that could mean financial ruin for chandra and her family, and the loss of the care ethan needs.you see, without insurance and the protections obamacare provides, chandra would have to , instead of  for the medical care ethan has received. she even posted the bill on twitter and proceeded to explain what s at stake.it seems fitting that, with thetrumpcare debate raging, i got this bill in the mail today from ethan s most recent open heart surgery. pic.twitter.com/  ali@) june ,  ll save you some math; without insurance we would , for  hours in the or,  week in the cicu and  week on the cardiac floor. pic.twitter.com/  ali@) june ,  s had four of these surgeries, some more involved than others. the one before this had him in the cicu for three weeks.  ali@) june ,  far, ethan s care has gone over  million mark. trump s healthcare bill would put lifetime caps on benefits, which means insurance companies would be able to deny coverage to ethan after reaching a fixed dollar amount. that means no healthcare for ethan unless his family goes broke to save him.that s not only cruel, it s inhumane, especially since republicans claim to be  pro-life. and ethan s medical care is not done yet.we re hopeful that going forwards he ll need fewer and smaller surgeries, but this was not the last time they ll open his chest.  ali@) june ,  surgeon who created what we call ethan s  picasso heart,  shaping  chambers from the  he was born with, is several states away.  ali@) june ,  also regularly see a local cardiologist, and electrophysiologist for his pacemaker, a pediatrician, immunology for his polysplenia.  ali@) june ,  takes  different prescription medications multiple times a day. all of this adds up. none of this would be possible without insurance.  ali@) june ,  i want you to go look at that number again. nearly a quarter million dollars for one surgery. reinstate lifetime caps and he s out.  ali@) june ,  blew past the million dollar mark long ago; i haven t even mentioned the er trips for sepsis workups every time his temp goes above .  ali@) june ,  the surprise admissions that sometimes follow those er visits when his body just isn t strong enough to fight a common virus at home.  ali@) june ,  trump and the republican party should be fighting to save this boy s life, not trying to kill him by taking away his healthcare.furthermore, the astronomical price of ethan s healthcare is morally wrong considering what similar medical care costs in other developed nations, especially those with socialized systems. according to twitter users who commented on chandra s post, ethan s medical bills in nations such as sweden and england would be far less.in sweden /year for healthcare and /year for meds. my breast cancer costed me  incl hysterektomi op  annika dahlberg@lovemylotus) june ,  has huge problems but it does work. i have three  hand examples of how serious, prolonged, excellent care costs zero.  richard ingham evans@) june , , in , a british couple unexpectedly had to have their baby delivered in an american hospital and end up being slapped with , medical bill for something that would have been free at a national health service hospital or , at a private facility in the uk.so whether provided by the government or by private hospitals, healthcare is far less expensive in other nations and is provided to all.that s what we need in america. instead, republicans are working on stripping healthcare away from millions of people.but chandra is determined to fight for her son s life even if republicans wont.a lifetime cap on benefits is the same as saying,  sorry, you re not worth keeping alive anymore. you re just too expensive.  ali@) june ,  my son in the eyes and tell him that he s fought so hard to be here but sorry, you re just not worth it anymore. i dare you. pic.twitter.com/igdqoounyb  ali@) june ,  image: screenshot  0          1\n",
       "if you want to know how trump treats the press, you need only read the white house press pool report from israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu s visit:the pool was then ushed into the oval. potus and benjamin netanyahu sat in two chairs set up in front of the fireplace. flotus sat on the couch to potus s right. sara netanyahu sat on the opposite couch. potus referred to the press as:  the nicest people over there. this remark was a clear attempt to soften up the people trump usually demonizes as  fake news  and the  lying media.  in fact, the report says trump even went out of his way to compliment  fake news  cnn s sarah murray on a recent story. it was then that murray, undeterred by the donald s effort to win her over with a couple compliments, asked her question and all hell broke loose:he called out to cnn s sara murray and complimented a recent story. she asked potus to comment on whether his advisors contacted russian intelligence officer during the campaign._trump did not respond to her question._* pool was asked to leave.this should have been an easy question for trump. the answer is  yes.  calls between key trump staffers have not only been intercepted and made public by our own intelligence agencies and those of our allies who now have to spy on us because trump is likely compromised. michael flynn just resigned because of his discussions of sanctions with the russian ambassador while obama was still president.instead, trump said nothing. no admission of wrongdoing, no promise to vet his people better or to actually do his f*cking duty to the american people, nothing.the terrifying thing is that trump doesn t have to say anything.house oversight committee jason chaffetz   that s the guy who led the charge against hillary clinton  has already vowed that he will never satisfy their desire to bring down donald trump.  rand paul accidentally admitted that republicans won t back a trump investigation because they re too busy taking healthcare away from our country s most vulnerable. besides, it s not like trump is a democrat, right? i just don t think it s useful to be doing investigation after investigation, particularly of your own party,  paul says.  we ll never even get started with doing the things we need to do, like repealing obamacare, if we re spending our whole time having republicans investigate republicans. i think it makes no sense. think about that. trump wasn t joking when he said he could shoot someone in public and not lose support   and he wasn t just talking about voters. at this point, we can pretty safely assume that our government is compromised to the point that he can literally get away with anything. you either have a country or you don t,  a small-handed orange man once said a few billion times. call your congressmen. demand they do the right thing and investigate and impeach donald j. trump now  while we still have a country.featured image via getty images/win mcnamee                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           0          1\n",
